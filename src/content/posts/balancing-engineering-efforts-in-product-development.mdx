Navigating the complexities of product development often sparks lively discussions about how to best allocate engineering resources. How can teams achieve the ideal balance between rolling out innovative new features, maintaining system stability, addressing bugs, and providing exceptional support? This post explores strategies to tackle this intricate challenge.

Imagine a scenario: there’s excitement around a groundbreaking feature ready to launch, but at the same time, reports of bugs are surfacing, the tech stack requires maintenance, and support tickets are stacking up. It’s a familiar crossroads for many engineering and product leaders. Striking the right balance is critical, and it starts with a strategic approach.

One way to approach this is by dividing efforts thoughtfully. For instance, consider allocating 60% of engineering resources to new feature development, 20% to maintenance, 10% to bug fixing, and 10% to support. While this framework seems straightforward, the real challenge lies in fine-tuning the details.

Getting this balance right is about more than just keeping engineering teams productive: it’s about ensuring products remain agile, users are delighted, and businesses scale effectively. In fast-paced environments where growth is a priority, this balance becomes a competitive advantage.

## Understanding the 60% for New Feature Development

Innovation is the engine of progress in product development.

Committing 60% of engineering efforts to new features keeps products competitive and responsive to evolving needs. Monitoring the time it takes for features to move from backlog to deployment can reveal whether this allocation is effective. If features are delayed longer than anticipated, it may signal a need to reassess resource distribution.

Rapid feature deployment ensures products stay aligned with market trends and user expectations.

## The Essential 20% for Maintenance

Stability is the foundation of user confidence.

Allocating 20% of engineering efforts to maintenance keeps existing features running smoothly. This work addresses technical debt, which, if ignored, can lead to glitches or performance issues. If technical debt begins to accumulate, it’s a sign that maintenance efforts may need adjustment.

Consistent maintenance ensures products scale reliably and maintain user trust.

## Dedicating 10% to Bug Fixing

A polished user experience requires proactive effort.

Setting aside 10% of resources for bug fixing allows teams to respond quickly to user feedback, maintaining a seamless experience. Tracking the average time to resolve reported bugs is key. A rise in resolution time could indicate bottlenecks or the need to reallocate resources.

Products that address issues swiftly build stronger reputations and foster user loyalty.

## Why 10% for Support Matters

Support is about more than fixing problems, it’s about elevating the user experience.

Dedicating 10% of efforts to support benefits both external users and internal teams. Measuring “First Response Time” (the average time before a user or team member receives an initial response) helps gauge effectiveness. If response times increase, it may be time to enhance support tools or staffing.

Prompt and efficient support creates a positive experience, making users and teams feel valued.

## Adjusting Percentages to Fit the Context

Every product, market, and team is unique.

Engineering and product leaders should feel confident adjusting these percentages based on feedback, market dynamics, and team capabilities. These shifts might be temporary to address immediate priorities, but they should always align with long-term goals.

Flexibility ensures products remain in sync with growth objectives and market demands.

## The Power of Feedback Loops

Continuous improvement thrives on feedback.

Cultivating a culture where input from users, stakeholders, and teams is regularly collected and acted upon strengthens resource allocation decisions. This feedback loop not only refines effort distribution but also shapes broader product strategies.

Products that stay connected to their audiences and teams are always ahead of the curve.

## In Summary

Balancing engineering efforts in product development can feel like a complex juggling act, especially in high-growth environments.

However, with a strategic allocation of resources and a close focus on key metrics, it transforms into a deliberate process with meaningful impact. While these percentages provide a starting point, adapting them to specific contexts and feedback loops is essential for success.

Every product and team has its own rhythm, challenges, and moments of brilliance. Embracing this dynamic nature is key to impactful outcomes.
