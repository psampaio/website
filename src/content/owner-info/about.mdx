Today, I’m dedicated to two passions: empowering product and engineering teams to excel through collaboration and streamlined processes, and building micro-SaaS products—compact, user-focused tools that solve real problems with simplicity and innovation. My dual expertise allows me to guide teams to deliver exceptional software while creating my own scalable, user-focused solutions.
